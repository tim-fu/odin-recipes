    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A recipe passed down from Malones for generations.</p>
    <p>This big bowl of happiness is perfect for the entire office — best served family style to boost coworkers' morale.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Large, heavy steel pot</li>
        <li>4 dried ancho chiles</li>
        <li>2 tbs vegetable or canola oil</li>
        <li>3 lbs ground beef</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 large jalapeño</li>
        <li>1 tbs dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbs tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 12 oz bottles of beer (lager or pale ale)</li>
        <li>3 cans pinto beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>3 cups beef stock</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups chopped ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbs kosher salt</li>
        <li>Chopped scallions, shredded Jack cheese, sour cream for topping</li>
        <li>File folders to mop up the mess</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Tear ancho chiles into pieces, discarding seeds and stems. In a large heavy pot, toast chiles over medium-high, stirring occasionally until very fragrant, 3 to 4 min. Process chiles in a food processor or spice mill until finely grounded.</li>
        <li>Add oil to pot and heat over medium-high. Add ground beef and cook, stirring occasionally to break beef into small pieces, until well browned (about 6 min). Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add onion to pot and cook briefly over medium-high until barely softened, about 2 min. The secret is to <strong>undercook the onions</strong>.</li>
        <li>Using a garlic press, press garlic directly into the pot. Then stir in jalapeños, oregano, cumin, cayenne pepper and tomato paste. Stir and cook until fragrant, about 2 min. Add beer and continue to cook, stirring and scraping the pan, about 7 min.</li>
        <li>Put beans in a large bowl and mash briefly with a potato masher until broken up but not fully mashed.</li>
        <li>Add mashed beans, stock, tomatoes, salt, and cooked beef to pot. Cover and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low to maintain simmer and cook 2 hours so everything gets to <em>know each other in the pot</em>. Remove from heat, uncover and let stand at least 1 hour (can also be refrigerated 8 hours or overnight).</li>
        <li>Reheat gently, taste and add more salt if necessary, and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
